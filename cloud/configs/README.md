# Search Engines

Search Engines are essentially aliases for the Chrome omnibar.

Here's an example of it working
![](https://github.com/SpencerWoo/cloud-dev-projects/blob/master/configs/assets/search_engine.gif)

You can set Chrome Search Engines by

(1) Visit `chrome://settings/searchEngines` in the address bar

(2) Chrome Menu > Settings > Manage Search Engines

(3) Right-click Chrome's address bar > Edit Search Engines

# User Scripts

This is an idea.  I'll implement for my own QoL once JIRA integration with ZD properly occurs.  Right now I don't believe there's a link between ZD and JIRA like there was with TS tickets.
